## The Burly-Q Brainstormer

This single-serving site creates concepts for burlesque acts, using [Kate Compton](http://www.galaxykate.com)'s [Tracery](http://tracery.io) library for procedural text generation. [Try it out!](https://pointfivetee.github.io/burlyq-brainstorm/)

The list of individual songs and artists was built using the [compilation albums of Grammy nominees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Nominees) from 1995 through 2017, in case you were wondering.
